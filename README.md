## Description
This pallet is designed to empower scientists, builders, and creators to secure their intellectual creations through **Proof of Innovation** and manage their IP licenses using **Smart Legal Contracts aka Ricardian Contracts**. Built on the Polkadot ecosystem, Softlaw ensures security and decentralization to IP rights and licensing.

## Intellectual Property Features

### Proof of Innovation Registry
Using NFTs, we create a secure database of Intellectual Property NFTs that safeguards your creations from misappropriation. This registry provides a legally recognized digital representation of your assets on-chain.

### IP License Management Tool
Combining legal principles with blockchain technology, we offer a Smart IP License Contract Factory that ensures the automated execution of intellectual property contracts. The terms and conditions of these license contracts are encoded directly into the blockchain runtime, ensuring security and decentralization. Features include automated payments, license revocations, rewards, and escrow management. Once you have a digital representation of your IP as an NFT digital twin, you can issue licenses to manage your intellectual property rights seamlessly.
